# the-Fashion-MNIST
This project involves building and training an AI model using the Fashion MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items in 10 categories, such as shirts, trousers, and sneakers. The goal is to develop an efficient image classification system that can accurately identify the category of a given fashion item.
