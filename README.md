Fashion MNIST AI Model
This repository contains an AI model trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset, a dataset of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 clothing categories. The project demonstrates building, training, and evaluating a machine learning model for image classification.

Features
Dataset: Fashion MNIST, containing 28x28 pixel grayscale images in 10 categories such as T-shirts, trousers, and shoes.
Model Architecture: A neural network leveraging convolutional layers for feature extraction.
Training Framework: TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch as applicable).
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix, and per-class precision/recall.
Deployment: Code includes options to save and load models for inference.
